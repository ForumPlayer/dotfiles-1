# Dotfiles
These are my personal dotfiles, essentially a mix of multiple other dotfiles, with my own spin on them.

The theming is based on Nord, with Firefox and Thunderbird with arc themes to match, transparency for Zathura and mostly other convenient factors.


I daily drive linux, for studying and development mostly. So this isn't particularly ricy but rather useful.

Feel free to copy however you'd like, just make sure to follow the requirements from the owners of each part of this dotfile repo.
